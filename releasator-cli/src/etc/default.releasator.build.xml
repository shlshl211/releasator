    <!--
    Rules:
    - you can import any number of other build files, but they will not be scanned for hook targets; all their functionality must be referenced from this file
    - if you change hook target name, it is no longer active
    - properly named hook targets without content and attribute @depends are ignored

    Recommendations:
    - put your functionality to separate targets, referenced via "depends" attribute from the hook target
    - to disable a hook target temporarily, change its prefix "on-" to "off-"; that way readers will still know that it is meant to function as a hook
